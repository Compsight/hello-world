Hello World Tutorial
I am the child of a naval telecommunications seaman who also worked as an electrician and an ATM repairman.
While growing up, I disassembled electronic toys to make new ones and reassembled the original toy to play with it again.
Watching my dad and experimenting with electronics gave me the confidence to update my own computer by myself after the first year of purchase. Luckily I found a computer shop who let me work on my own stuff while in their store. After completing my motherboard upgrade successfully, I started to veer away from being an obstetrician/pediatrician (people doctor) to a computer technician (computer doctor).
I gained further knowledge to become a Systems Administrator, VoIP Engineer, and technical guru in all things electronics and/or technology.
